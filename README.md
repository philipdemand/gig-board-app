Users can create an account either as a musician or as a director (holder of a gig event). Musicians can see available gigs and apply to fill an available seat or cancel an application. This app will also organize gigs for musicians according to their application status or lack thereof. Directors can post a gig with details, and manage musicians by either accepting or rejecting their applications. Directors can edit the details of their posted gig, and remove it from the app.
